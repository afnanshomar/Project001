# Project001

This project contains various questions that demonstrate how to use built-in functions in the **NumPy** library.  
NumPy allows us to perform complex computations involving multidimensional arrays and matrices, generate random values,  
and execute common mathematical operations efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Learn how to use **NumPyâ€™s built-in functions**.
- Work with **arrays, matrices, and mathematical computations**.
- Generate **random numbers and perform statistical operations**.
- Understand how **NumPy simplifies everyday programming tasks**.

## ðŸš€ Installation
Install NumPy using:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
